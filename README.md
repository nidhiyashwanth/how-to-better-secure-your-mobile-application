### Introduction Security

-The goal is to make Android the safest mobile platform in the world. That's why we consistently invest in technologies that bolster the security of the platform, its apps, and the global Android ecosystem.
-I'm delighted to share with you my findings on how to keep users safe and secure.

### Encrypt your data

- The Security library provides an implementation of the [security best practices](https://developer.android.com/topic/security/best-practices) related to reading and writing data at rest, as well as key creation and verification.
